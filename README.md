## Getting Started 🏃🏽‍♂️

**Follow these commands to check it out on your machine**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/juan-calle/player-cards-stats-component.git

cd player-cards-stats-component

npm install
```

Once you have installed you can access the index.html file located in [./src/components/player-stats-card/intex.html](https://github.com/juan-calle/player-cards-stats-component/blob/31e0e581519a28d21525a61916545e5f507545df/src/components/player-stats-card/index.html)

And then create a build of the component so Sass can be compiled and the styles injected in the Shadow Dom, like this:

```sh
  npm run build
```

PRs  welcome! 😄
